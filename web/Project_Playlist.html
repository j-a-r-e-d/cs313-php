		<h1>ROAD-TRIP PLAYLIST MAKER</h1>
		<div id="synopsis">
			<p>This application was created to help you create a playlist of your favorite songs for a road-trip. Because the length of travel time will determine the playback length of the playlist it was planned that this application would take user location and destination in order to tally the drive time. Then, the playlist could be filled by the user with enough songs to fill that drive-time estimate. If the user did not select enough songs to fill the full drive-time, then the user could opt for an "autofill" which would randomly repeat songs the user had already selected until the playback time had met or surpassed the drive-time.</p>
			<p>Also, it was planned that the user could add his own choice of Artist, Album, Songs to the database for future selection.</p>
			<p>The current state of the application only allows users to enter their data, including location information, and select from pre-existing song data in the system. The autofill option is not ready yet, nor does the app calculate drive-time between user location and destination.</p>
